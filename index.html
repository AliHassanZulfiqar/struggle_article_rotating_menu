        <p><b>“It’s okay to struggle. That’s how you get stronger.”</b></p>
        <p>
          That was wise career advice from … my Pilates instructor. Of course, she was talking about struggle and building physical strength, but the same principle applies to career-building too.

          Struggling sucks. No question. Sure, we know it’s an inherent part of life, and even helpful for growth, but nobody wakes up in the morning, crosses their fingers and says, "man I really hope I struggle today." And yet here we are, each of us struggling with something or other. So let’s look at the bright side of the struggle, shall we?
        </p>

        <h3>Struggle</h3>

        <h3>Struggle is better for performance … eventually.</h3>
        <p>Research shows that people who struggle with a problem on their own before receiving assistance actually perform better than people who haven’t had to struggle -- on the second time they encounter a problem.</p>
        <p>
        So if initial performance is all you care about, struggle isn’t necessarily going to help you. But if you care about long-term performance, as you should, then your struggle will likely pay off.
        </p>
        <p>
        Researchers called this “productive failure.” They say fumbling with a problem early on fostered “hidden efficacy” because it led to deeper understanding of the problem after struggling with it.
        </p> 
        <p>  
        The takeaway? Focusing exclusively on initial performance is myopic. Struggling trumps ease in the long run.
